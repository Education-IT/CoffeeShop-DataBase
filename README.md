## Course Project - *Databases* - **UAM**

> **Completed in the second semester of computer science studies.**

The task was to create a real-world usable database. During the project, I worked as a Store Coffee Master at Starbucks, which is why I chose a coffee shop as the subject. I tried to replicate the company's principles, such as financial performance control, suggestive selling by employees, and the best-selling products.
